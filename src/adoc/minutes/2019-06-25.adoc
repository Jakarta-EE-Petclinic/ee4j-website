Discuessed the need for creating an issue to merge the security projects to contain all security related specs. JACC, jaspic and security api.

Concern that project (leads) do not know what to update in the spec docs. 
We should provide some guidance to the project leads about what they need to do. 
The docs will be standard boilerplate. Will be on the steering committee
