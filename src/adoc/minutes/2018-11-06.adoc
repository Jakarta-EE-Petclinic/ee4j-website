https://www.eclipse.org/lists/ee4j-pmc/msg01195.html 

=== Specification Projects

Close discussion on https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/issues/34 and make recommendation.

According to discussions in the PMC following this thread, the PMC will issue a statement saying that jakarta.* will be a requirement as module names for future releases. The current release should keep the module names as defined in the Java EE 8 version of the spec, or no module name at all.

=== Implementation Projects

Close discussion on https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j/issues/35 and make recommendation.

This statement is only about module names, not package names. Module names must not be jakarta.* or anything containing ee4j. Otherwise common Eclipse practice must be followed. Note that this is not about package names.
Action: Take this statement to the mailing list and.

== GIT Tag name conventions

https://www.eclipse.org/lists/ee4j-pmc/msg01186.html 

The PMC recommends:

* Use version number as TAG name
* Use annotated tags

If a project wants to deviate from this, it is ok. A released version MUST be tagged.

== GIT Security Alerts

https://www.eclipse.org/lists/ee4j-pmc/msg01313.html 

Decide on how we should handle this.
Do project leads get these notifications?
Whoâ€™s responsibility is it to handle these? Eclipse Security team?

Action: Wayne will create an issue so we can discuss what we should do and define a process.

== Release Reviews

Some members have noticed EE4J projects being released to Maven Central without release review according to the EDP.
