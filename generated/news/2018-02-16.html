<h1>PMC statement about initial EE4J project contributions</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first significant milestone for the EE4J project is releasing Eclipse GlassFish as JavaEE 8 compatible as soon as
possible. In light of this we need to ensure that changes in project repositories don’t break Java EE 8 compatibility
and cause a release delay. Currently the TCKs for projects haven’t been moved over to EE4J so we are not in a position
where we can test pull requests (PRs) to ensure they pass the TCK and retain compatibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this in mind we are proposing a number of restrictions on projects during this transition.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>GitHub branch protection must be switched on for all projects and all branches except <strong>sandbox</strong> branches and repos.
<strong>Sandbox</strong> branches and repositories are defined and setup by a project lead. The Master branch must be protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all protected branches/repos the following applies:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>For each proposed change an issue must be raised and discussed and a subsequent PR must be raised. No direct commits
are allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A PR must be reviewed by other project committers and receive <strong>at least one approval</strong> to be merged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Initial contribution must be tagged with an <strong>Initial Contribution</strong> tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Project lead for each project creates a protected <code>EE4J_8</code> branch based on the initial contribution tag.
This branch will be the version for the first platform release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to merge a PR into the EE4J_8 branch <strong>project lead</strong> or PMC approval is required and the change must be
tested against the TCK which is currently not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PMC strongly recommends accepting only critical bug fixes to the <code>EE4J_8</code> branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Master branch will be used for changes that will go into the next platform release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All changes related to the next EE4J platform release must be proposed by creating an issue, a corresponding branch
will subsequently be created followed by a PR to Master.</p>
</li>
</ol>
